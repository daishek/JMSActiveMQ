# ActiveMQ JMS

The project at hand is a comprehensive and modular implementation of Apache ActiveMQ and Java Message Service (JMS) for efficient message exchange and communication within a distributed system. This project has been designed to facilitate the exchange of messages and data between various components and applications in a way that is both scalable and maintainable.

> Please note that this project is part of my university's etudes projects for the Internet of Things (IoT) module, which involves using Apache ActiveMQ with JMS and is organized into multiple Java projects for managing queues, topics, and subscribers.
